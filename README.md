# Convex_Hull_Implementation
This project implements the Convex Hull algorithm using finite state machines (FSMs) and digital logic components, based on the Jarvis March Algorithm. The design efficiently computes the convex hull in hardware by utilizing a leftmost point detection system with counters and multiplexers to determine the starting point. An orientation calculator with sub-circuits ensures strict convex hull formation, correctly handling collinear points. The implementation also includes a Modulo-3 FSM synchronization mechanism for register control and timing. The circuit is designed and simulated using Proteus.
